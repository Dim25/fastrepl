      "5: Stayed at the Wm Penn down the street for a wedding and needed a last minute haircut. Friendly, helpful, all around good cut!\n",
      "4: We tried out the lunch specials and found them to be pretty good.  For about $6 we both got healthy portions of spicy food along with fairly good service.  Take a chance and go for the hotter dishes.  :-)\n",
      "1: Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can't see the food on your plate. Underwhelming and overpriced.\n",
      "2: This place has sure changed...and not for the better. they totally re-did the menu and got rid of many yummy things they used to serve.\\nThere are still the desserts but the little sliders are off the menu and those were my favorite!\\nSo I bring my little guy here for a little dinner & chocolate treat. Our server tells me she is also a mom and whatnot. Ok lady..lets get this this started...I am with a 2 year old. I might be crazy but when the server says she is a parent I expect them to understand & TRY to be quick with things.\\nThis girl was not quick..she was very very slow.\\nFinally when the food arrived his grilled mac & cheese was cold. Thankfully he did not care. She offered to take it back and warm it up but there was no way he was going to go for that. He was hungry.\\nWe finally order the chocolate pizza for dessert after waiting way to long for her to come back and check on us.\\nThe pizza of course takes forever & I am trying to keep my kid from climbing the walls. Once it gets there tho my kiddo is in heaven. He tore into that pizza. He was in heaven. He was dancing in his chair...singing Yum Yum in my belly. It was awesome. And for that they should get 5 stars. But when I factor everything in they are down to 2 stars. Sorry Max..Prob wont be coming back again.\n",
      "5: I've been bringing my son to the owner Michael Joyner and everytime we come in we are greeted and never have to wait long no matter what day we come in. Even if he is busy he always makes time to fit us in especially with my crazy schedule. Great location, customer service and professionalism. I always refer 5 Star to anyone looking for an excellent barber!!!!!! Thanks Mike\n",
      "1: The trip to the location takes two busses and the wait was do long we cancelled our reservation and took a taxi ... Don't waste your time and effort on this dump!\n",
      "4: This restaurant was suggested to me by a friend.  \\n\\nWe were seated half way between the outdoor patio and the interior.  The restaurant is sexy and dark....hard to read your menu dark, but that's ok.  The vibe is lounge, with an extraordinary wine list.\\n\\nEverything on the menu looks amazing.  It was hard to choose, but we finally settled on the sausage flatbread, pesto cream pasta and the hamachi.  All were incredible, flavorful and fresh.  I was surprised how spicy and perfect the flatbread was, only because pizza crust can be tricky at a restaurant that isn't really a pizza place.\\n\\nWe skipped dessert, so I can't comment on that.\\n\\nService started great.  As the night went on, the server became more absent and we finally had to stop a random waiter to get the check.\\n\\nI plan on coming back.  For drinks or dinner, it's a great place to go with a group or a date.\n",
      "3: This place is unique because you are sitting outside in a garden that is covered when it is raining, the food was alright but it was over priced and there are very limited options for vegetarians, and almost none for vegans.\\n\\nI know this isn't the right town for a vegetarian or a vegan but they could add a few more options for us. I am giving them 3 stars for the atmosphere and excellent service.\n",
      "3: Whew, $10 for a whiskey ginger ale and $18 for a martini.  We must be in Las Vegas. \\n\\nOh wait, yes we are.  Red Square is worth it for the ambiance, if you ask me.  I'd like to have seen more of what they had to offer.  The \\\"ice bar\\\" that gets a lot of hype isn't as impressive as it sounds.\\n\\nThe staff were pretty slow - I think 3 of them behind the bar, and we waited 10 minutes before being served and once our orders were taken they were in no rush to serve either.  Tipped minimally, but otherwise they weren't jerks or anything.  It's not like they were busy, either - it was a Tuesday night in February.  \\n\\nI'm being kind of hard on them, but we did have fun and it's a neat theme.  We did not go back in the vodka room, though.  Maybe next time.\n",
      "4: Loove me some Pei Wei! Boyfriend isn't a fan, so whenever I end up eating alone, this is my go-to. \\n\\nI have a bad habit of ordering the same thing over and over once I find something I like, so I can only say that the Dan-Dan Noodles are amazing! The eggrolls are also delicious. Taste can vary with regard to spiciness, but it's generally pretty consistent. \\n\\nTheir online ordering system is my favorite and my food is ready and waiting on time, every time. The staff is super friendly. \\n\\nGreat stop for some quick, tasty Asian food (I believe they cover at least 5 different Asian cuisines).\n",
      "5: I have been looking for a perfect Thai food restaurant for years and I have finally found it at Yupah's. I have tried countless Thai restaurants from Thai Rama to Latitude Eight to Thai basil and none of them compare to the food and atmosphere of Yupah's. \\n\\nThe prices are standard to Thai but the food is out of this world! You can really taste every single flavor. I tried the tom Kai gai coconut soup and it is by far my favorite. The lemon grass and spices are amazing. Every flavor is present served amazingly. The service is incredible as well. Everyone is extremely friendly. The red curry is without a doubt the best food on the menu. I absolutely love it. \\n\\nDefinitely go here. No other place compares! I love Yupah's!\n",
      "4: This restaurant has a nice classic American decor; kind of American farmer, Route 66ish decor..very quaint. The food was very good and the service was really good too. Family owned, you can tell that they really care about their customers.  We will definitely be coming back.\n",
      "4: DH was getting pizza at #1 Brothers so I originally tried to order from the Japanese restaurant in the same plaza, but they failed to answer the phone after we called FOUR times!  Thank goodness.  Went to Ari and got the usual excellent service and good sushi.  What made me feel good---I was explaining to the girl who answered the phone that I had ordered the spicy tuna handroll before and had been disappointed in its consistency and our server had suggested a order it more coarsely chopped.  The young lady on the phone said: \\\"Oh, yes, that was me---I was your server and I remember.  I know exactly what you want!\\\"  And she did.  My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.  Also, when I explained to her what my favorite specialty roll had been back at my old sushi joint, she was able to suggest a roll that very nearly the same and very good.  Actually, wait.  This was a Four star rather than a three star experience---let me go change my rating.  I feel like I have found my forever sushi place!  Thank you, Ari, for making me feel like a valued customer and not a faceless diner.\n",
      "1: A EVITER !\\n\\nNous avons attendu 2h45 pour avoir un plat de nachos... et le patron est venu m'insulter parce que je demandais un geste commercial pour cette attente interminable !! On parlait juste de chips avec de la sauce tomate... et ils n'\\u00e9taient m\\u00eame pas bons !!!\\n\\nNous n'y remettrons jamais les pieds. Nous trouverons une autre place pour voir les matchs des Canadiens \\n\\nUne \\u00e9toile,  pour les serveuses qui supportent un tel patron !\n",
      "1: DO NOT ORDER FROM VITACOST!!!\\n\\nI have never wanted to give a place a negative star rating more than I do this company.\\n\\nI placed an order last Monday. After it had not been shipped by Friday afternoon, I sent an email inquiring about the expected ship date. I then got onto their live chat with a customer service representative who told me that the order had been invoiced and shipped, it just wasn't posted yet. Later, I found out that she had lied to me and that the order shipped that night, after I had inquired about it. I received an email citing the wrong order number that also included gross grammatical errors (i.e., subject-verb agreement, thanking me for my \\\"patients\\\").\\n\\nI responded to complain that the live-chat representative had lied to me and also wanted to confirm that the correct order had been shipped because the representative who emailed me had cited a different order number. I also cited the unprofessionalism of the email. I received a response apologizing for the unprofessional grammatical errors in the \\\"precious\\\" email. I received no apology for the lies, however, nor an incentive to try their services again.\\n\\nI received my order yesterday. It was missing four items and contained one wrong item. I sent a pretty angry and detailed email and posted a message on their Facebook page.\\n\\nI was contacted via phone today. I detailed the problem with the shipping, lying and now the missing/wrong items again. She said that the problem with shipping and being lied to had been taken care of internally. She was then ready to go. I had to ASK about the missing and wrong items. She asked what they were (which had already been detailed in my last email). She told me I would get a reimbursement to my account in 48-72 hours. Fine.\\n\\nA little while later, I get an email from a representative and a comment on my Facebook post, both saying that management had left me a message with their direct number to call and resolve the issue. WHAT?????? I just SPOKE with the representative and resolved the issue. They clearly have no clue what is happening in their own company!\\n\\nThe unprofessionalism and carelessness at Vitacost is unbelievable. I ordered from them to not just save on cost but also on time. The time I have had to put into this is greater than the time I would have spent just going to the store to get everything myself, which I now have to do anyway!\n",
      "4: Went here today to get some sushi grade salmon and tuna! This is my go-to place whenever I'm in the mood of making sushi. Fish is always fresh on all the times I've came. \\n\\nI also picked some beef and pork meat- both were good prices, cheaper than most places and are fresh.\\n\\nGot my vegetables from onions to eggplants. \\n\\nAlso passed by the bakery section and bought strawberry and taro cake @ $2.50/pc, haven't tried them, hope it's good!\\n\\nAlso passed by deli and bought some chickens feet @ $2.25/4 pcs -- I used to eat them back when I was little in the Philippines and haven't tried them since, I'd say it's pretty good from what I remember. \\n\\nOverall a great place to shop for asian food and delicacies, too bad it's about 40 minutes away from me.\n",
      "4: Lots of hands on stuff to do and explore. My faves - the robots - they never miss shooting baskets and will kick your ass at air hockey. Fun and informative way to kill an afternoon.\n",
      "2: I just started working at a corporate office in Scottsdale Quarter and tried out C3 on my second week. \\n\\nI have to say I was not impressed on any level.\\n\\nWell, that's not entirely true. The one level that was SUPER impressed about was this. There is a guy who takes orders and he was amazing. I waited in line for about 5 minutes and watched as he helped everyone in front of me with all kind of questions, issues, and orders. and He was hilarious when it was my time to order since it was my first time in the restaurant. I wish I would have caught his name to give him more kudos. \\n\\nOther than that though, I could give this place a C-. \\n\\nWe ordered a salad and a sandwich. My co workers salad arrived probably 20 + minutes after we ordered and my sandwich was nowhere in sight. After ten more minutes I went in to ask and was told \\\"its coming its coming hold on.\\\" five minutes later it showed up, soggy and extremely disappointing. I ate three bites, and decided to call it quits. My co workers salad looked delicious but I have no idea if it was or not. \\n\\nOverall, eh.\n",
      "5: Went to this place and it is the bomb. I had shrimp and it was delicious . I would definitely recommend this place for everyone.\n",
      "4: I was never really a fan of Hamburgers so my review won't be just on the food. \\n\\nThe Bad about this place. \\nVery crowded. Huge lines. No place to sit because of the crowds. Had to sit outside in 100degree Vegas heat. I think thats all I can think of...\\n\\nThe Good\\nVery quick service for these kind of lines. \\nThe burgers and fries tasted just like the ones we have at home in Los Angeles. Maybe alittle better even on the burger or maybe I was just hungry. Extra bathrooms in their second building for merchandise.\n",
      "4: Just opened and boy is the pizza great.  A awesome value at lunch, 10\\\" pizza or sub and drink for less than $6.  My son tried the wings the other night and rated them so so but that might be just because they just opened. I rate them certainly the best of the chain pizza restaurants.  I'll certainly be back.\n",
      "2: They do not have their own bathroom. I came here with my friends today and they told us if we had to go to the bathroom, we were going to have to go to the casino next door. \\n\\nWe're used to Froyo where we can get our own amounts and put our own toppings on it. If your used to this lifestyle, be prepared to be let down at Pinkberry on the strip. They serve the yogurt for you and put on the toppings for you. \\n\\nI guess in Vegas with all the intoxicated people you don't want a free for all topping service bar. Take me back to the Bay for Froyo, please!\n",
      "2: so far, this is the most deceptive yelp rating we have found. this is NOT a 4.5 star mexican restaurant., and it really isn't even a 3 star eatery. our start here was good, with tasty chips and salsa and a kind waitress whose english was very shaky (all of which we took as a promising sign).  we had high hopes as we waited far too long for our food, but the warning signs were already there; the worst margaritas ever, not even one other party arriving for dinner, and a drab dining room that looked much better in the photos. when the food finally did come, it was just disappointing.  and while the salsa that came with the chips was good, both the red sauce, and green sauce that was brought to the table with the food were both lousy. the beans were salty, the rice was weird, and i believe the taco shells were from a box. not one in our party of 5 were the slightest bit impressed with the food quality. not sure why it's so difficult to find decent mexican food in this town, but it is! steer far away from el ranchero, it's one of the poorest i have ever been to. cannot believe that some people ranked it so highly! the only one in the east valley has received rave reviews from us so far, has been \\\"susies mexican cafe\\\" in east tempe. take the drive!\n",
      "2: Pretty okay pizza.  Standard so-so Pittsburgh pizza.  However , the fact that the delivery driver expected me to run from my second floor apartment out to the middle of the street to get it was not okay.  He was rude when I asked him to come up, talking about how he has other deliveries to make and he couldn't park (meanwhile, there were multiple open parking spaces directly in front of the apartment; as well as an entire parking lot right next door). \\n\\nAfter arguing with me for a few minutes, he finally decided to park and come up. I really don't want to have to argue with someone to get them to do their job when I order delivery. And I certainly don't want to have to leave my house, to go out in the cold, for what is supposed to be delivery.   Is it so strange to expect food delivery to make it to my actual doorstep?  This seems to be a recent trend, pizza delivery people expecting the customer to run out into the street to get their pizza.  It stopped me from ordering from another place, and it will stop me from ordering from Ephesus again.\n",
      "5: Amazing atmosphere, great service, fantastic drinks and really good food.   For someone to say this place is over priced is  completely ridiculous.....  If you are paying $8 for a water in the hotel gift shop, what do you expect to pay for an entree at one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas?  Expect to spend like $75 a person if you order a 3 course meal with drinks.  I highly recommend this to any group, party or couple visiting Las Vegas.  This is my 2nd time at TAO and I have not had a bad meal.  You wont be disappointed!\n",
      "2: Tried Envy based on the ratings that people left.  However, came out feeling disappointed.  First off, we started with the mozzarella caprese.  This was our favorite dish with heirloom tomatoes and their balsamic vinegarette.  Next up, the seafood tower for 2.  Came with 2 King crab legs, 4 tiger prawns, 4 raw oysters, and 4 raw clams.  The entrees were truly UNexceptional.  I ordered the Pan Fried Chilean Sea Bass with crab on top which came with a mushy slimy pile of \\\"wild\\\" mushrooms.  Slightly undercooked and much too greasy for the Sea Bass.  My partner ordered the Rib Eye medium rare.  The outside was charred while the inside was rare-red.  In addition, there was a pool of oil in the middle of the steak.  We sent it back to get a second grilling since it was not medium rare.  The second round came back the same.  Sides included a garlic mashed potato and seasonal vegetables.  The potatos were good while the vegetables were mushy, charred, and came with sprigs of rosemary mixed in.  I ended up having to pick out the rosemary branches like fish bones as they were poking my mouth and unedible.  We also ordered the creamed corn side, which was surprisingly fresh.\\n\\nAll in all, not worth the price.  I'd say order the appetizers and sides, but stay away from the entrees.  In addition, service was pretty shoddy.  Our waiter kept disappearing.  I do however give props to the waiter's assistant.\n",
      "2: Just got back from a stay at the Phoenician.   Although the resort was beautiful, I was thoroughly disappointed in their service and won't return. I don't take a lot of vacations but do like to stay at a top notch place when I do go. For me, the service is by far the most important aspect on my trips and I found the staff at the Phoenician lacking in that respect. We were given a mountain view room. Typically, when I hear a hotel advertise mountain versus pool view rooms, it's not a big deal to me (in fact, I'd prefer the mountain except if I'm in a coastal hotel with a view of the ocean). In this case though, what they mean by mountain is opening your shade and being right next to a mountain (so close you can tell the bugs on the bushes). So essentially, you don't really have a view. That wasn't the greatest, but the bigger problem was I had no phone reception on half of the room and the other half I was only able to get one bar (clearly a result of being right next to a mountain). We went to the NCAA basketball game on our first day in town so we weren't in the room much. The next morning, I went down to use the fitness facility and found it to be sub-par for a hotel of the level of the Phoenician (needed a serious refresh...they have a bunch of antiquated machines and spin bikes). I asked the concierge if she knew of a track nearby (figured I'd just go for a jog instead since I didn't like the fitness center). She had some maps laid out for jogs on the complex but I informed her that running on asphalt takes its toll on my knees and that I really needed a track. I asked if there was a college nearby and she directed me to ASU, but gave me bad directions (had me turn right on Camelback and it should have been left). I drove for about 35 minutes and never came across the first street that I was supposed to turn on (Scottsdale Blvd). So that wasted over an hour of my time for nothing. As I kept having calls drop off on my phone, I became more annoyed with the situation and by Saturday morning complained to the front desk. The snooty clerk replied..\\\"well sir, we can't do anything about the way the hotel is constructed\\\". I thought to myself, so what are you saying?...your customers have to suck it up and deal with it? I would think a more professional clerk would have apologized for the inconvenience and immediately look to switch my room (instead of me telling the clerk that this wouldn't do). So I had the room switched but it wasn't available yet (it was 7am). He said I would receive a call informing me when the room was ready. By 12:30, we hadn't received a call and had to leave for the game so I called the front desk. The clerk said to leave our packed luggage on the bed and it would be moved for us to the new room by the time we got back. We arrived back at the hotel at 5. The new room was ready but the luggage hadn't been moved (they said they would take care of it right away). So we went to the bar for a little over an hour. We got back to the room...still no luggage. I called back to the desk and the clerk apologized and said it would be done right way). After another hour and still no luggage, I went to the desk and complained (we had 8 o'clock dinner reservations at a restaurant away from the hotel and needed to change clothes). We finally received our luggage just before 7:30 and needless to say didn't really have time to freshen up a bit before dinner (actually just got to the restaurant at 8). Although the front desk manager apologized the next day, it really didn't matter to me at that point. She asked what she could do to make me happy and offered to comp a massage or a free meal. I just asked if it was possible to get an \\\"uneventful\\\" day from her staff (which was really all I wanted all along). She had a look on her face like she didn't even know how to respond to that request (as though that might be asking the impossible). I mentioned that I really didn't think I was asking too much to have our luggage delivered and perhaps her staff could have at least made sure we had some ice (they don't have ice machines so we had to call room service for ice). She was surprised by the ice comment and questioned whether we had had turn down service (apparently the maids are supposed to deliver ice every night). I informed her we never received ice in the 3 nights we had been there and I had to call for it (and of course, tip their room service which I thought was bogus). She did end up comping our lunch but honestly it just didn't matter. I can't stand it when a 5 star hotel provides shoddy service like this. There are plenty of deals out there especially with the economy being in the shape it's in (even for 5 star hotels). My wife actually chose the hotel (I was pushing for the Four Seasons). The last day at the hotel was our 25th wedding anniversary, but I was just too annoyed to really enjoy it. Too bad the staff doesn't realize they ruin people's stays when they can't deliver a quality experience.\n",
      "5: I heard mixed reviews about Lure. We decided to try it out yesterday. This place has a great atmosphere. The food was delicious and service was great. I dont have anything negative to say.\n",
      "4: Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot.\n",
      "2: I was very disappointed with my meal here. It is WAY overpriced, even by Vegas standards.\\n\\nI had the Black Pepper chicken. It was like Beef and Broccoli, but with asparagus instead of the broc. Very bland and flavorless. Had to heap on the chili sauce to enhance the flavor. \\n\\nOthers in my group had the mushroom & poor noodle dish. The noodles were very good, but the mushroom sauce was just mediocre. Another dish we shared was the fried eggplant sauce. These were limp and soaked in oil. The flavor was fine, but there just wasnt much going on with this dish.\\n\\nWe had 3 iced teas at a whopping $5 each!!! As well as a side (1 cup) of steamed rice ($3). The final bill was $80. Ouch. I wasn't even full. We used a $50 food voucher and and I STILL felt like I overpaid. \\n\\nI would rather eat Panda Express and I don't even like that place.\\n\\nIf you are in Caesar's, come here and watch the chefs make fresh noodles and check out the decor. It's a super unique finish. But then keep moving...Vegas has too many great options to bother with this spot.\n"

Our server tells me she is also a mom and whatnot. Ok lady..lets get this this started...I am with a 2 year old. I might be crazy but when the server says she is a parent I expect them to understand & TRY to be quick with things.\\nThis girl was not quick..she was very very slow.\\nFinally when the food arrived his grilled mac & cheese was cold. Thankfully he did not care. She offered to take it back and warm it up but there was no way he was going to go for that. He was hungry.\\nWe finally order the chocolate pizza for dessert after waiting way to long for her to come back and check on us.\\nThe pizza of course takes forever & I am trying to keep my kid from climbing the walls. Once it gets there tho my kiddo is in heaven. He tore into that pizza. He was in heaven. He was dancing in his chair...singing Yum Yum in my belly. It was awesome. And for that they should get 5 stars. But when I factor everything in they are down to 2 stars. Sorry Max..Prob wont be coming back again.\n",
      "5: I've been bringing my son to the owner Michael Joyner and everytime we come in we are greeted and never have to wait long no matter what day we come in. Even if he is busy he always makes time to fit us in especially with my crazy schedule. Great location, customer service and professionalism. I always refer 5 Star to anyone looking for an excellent barber!!!!!! Thanks Mike\n",
      "1: The trip to the location takes two busses and the wait was do long we cancelled our reservation and took a taxi ... Don't waste your time and effort on this dump!\n",
      "0: This restaurant was suggested to me by a friend.  \\n\\nWe were seated half way between the outdoor patio and the interior.  The restaurant is sexy and dark....hard to read your menu dark, but that's ok.  The vibe is lounge, with an extraordinary wine list.\\n\\nEverything on the menu looks amazing.  It was hard to choose, but we finally settled on the sausage flatbread, pesto cream pasta and the hamachi.  All were incredible, flavorful and fresh.  I was surprised how spicy and perfect the flatbread was, only because pizza crust can be tricky at a restaurant that isn't really a pizza place.\\n\\nWe skipped dessert, so I can't comment on that.\\n\\nService started great.  As the night went on, the server became more absent and we finally had to stop a random waiter to get the check.\\n\\nI plan on coming back.  For drinks or dinner, it's a great place to go with a group or a date.\n",
      "0: This place is unique because you are sitting outside in a garden that is covered when it is raining, the food was alright but it was over priced and there are very limited options for vegetarians, and almost none for vegans.\\n\\nI know this isn't the right town for a vegetarian or a vegan but they could add a few more options for us. I am giving them 3 stars for the atmosphere and excellent service.\n",
      "3: Whew, $10 for a whiskey ginger ale and $18 for a martini.  We must be in Las Vegas. \\n\\nOh wait, yes we are.  Red Square is worth it for the ambiance, if you ask me.  I'd like to have seen more of what they had to offer.  The \\\"ice bar\\\" that gets a lot of hype isn't as impressive as it sounds.\\n\\nThe staff were pretty slow - I think 3 of them behind the bar, and we waited 10 minutes before being served and once our orders were taken they were in no rush to serve either.  Tipped minimally, but otherwise they weren't jerks or anything.  It's not like they were busy, either - it was a Tuesday night in February.  \\n\\nI'm being kind of hard on them, but we did have fun and it's a neat theme.  We did not go back in the vodka room, though.  Maybe next time.\n",
      "5: Loove me some Pei Wei! Boyfriend isn't a fan, so whenever I end up eating alone, this is my go-to. \\n\\nI have a bad habit of ordering the same thing over and over once I find something I like, so I can only say that the Dan-Dan Noodles are amazing! The eggrolls are also delicious. Taste can vary with regard to spiciness, but it's generally pretty consistent. \\n\\nTheir online ordering system is my favorite and my food is ready and waiting on time, every time. The staff is super friendly. \\n\\nGreat stop for some quick, tasty Asian food (I believe they cover at least 5 different Asian cuisines).\n",
      "0: I have been looking for a perfect Thai food restaurant for years and I have finally found it at Yupah's. I have tried countless Thai restaurants from Thai Rama to Latitude Eight to Thai basil and none of them compare to the food and atmosphere of Yupah's. \\n\\nThe prices are standard to Thai but the food is out of this world! You can really taste every single flavor. I tried the tom Kai gai coconut soup and it is by far my favorite. The lemon grass and spices are amazing. Every flavor is present served amazingly. The service is incredible as well. Everyone is extremely friendly. The red curry is without a doubt the best food on the menu. I absolutely love it. \\n\\nDefinitely go here. No other place compares! I love Yupah's!\n",
      "0: This restaurant has a nice classic American decor; kind of American farmer, Route 66ish decor..very quaint. The food was very good and the service was really good too. Family owned, you can tell that they really care about their customers.  We will definitely be coming back.\n",
      "4: DH was getting pizza at #1 Brothers so I originally tried to order from the Japanese restaurant in the same plaza, but they failed to answer the phone after we called FOUR times!  Thank goodness.  Went to Ari and got the usual excellent service and good sushi.  What made me feel good---I was explaining to the girl who answered the phone that I had ordered the spicy tuna handroll before and had been disappointed in its consistency and our server had suggested a order it more coarsely chopped.  The young lady on the phone said: \\\"Oh, yes, that was me---I was your server and I remember.  I know exactly what you want!\\\"  And she did.  My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.  Also, when I explained to her what my favorite specialty roll had been back at my old sushi joint, she was able to suggest a roll that very nearly the same and very good.  Actually, wait.  This was a Four star rather than a three star experience---let me go change my rating.  I feel like I have found my forever sushi place!  Thank you, Ari, for making me feel like a valued customer and not a faceless diner.\n",
      "1: A EVITER !\\n\\nNous avons attendu 2h45 pour avoir un plat de nachos... et le patron est venu m'insulter parce que je demandais un geste commercial pour cette attente interminable !! On parlait juste de chips avec de la sauce tomate... et ils n'\\u00e9taient m\\u00eame pas bons !!!\\n\\nNous n'y remettrons jamais les pieds. Nous trouverons une autre place pour voir les matchs des Canadiens \\n\\nUne \\u00e9toile,  pour les serveuses qui supportent un tel patron !\n",
      "0: DO NOT ORDER FROM VITACOST!!!\\n\\nI have never wanted to give a place a negative star rating more than I do this company.\\n\\nI placed an order last Monday. After it had not been shipped by Friday afternoon, I sent an email inquiring about the expected ship date. I then got onto their live chat with a customer service representative who told me that the order had been invoiced and shipped, it just wasn't posted yet. Later, I found out that she had lied to me and that the order shipped that night, after I had inquired about it. I received an email citing the wrong order number that also included gross grammatical errors (i.e., subject-verb agreement, thanking me for my \\\"patients\\\").\\n\\nI responded to complain that the live-chat representative had lied to me and also wanted to confirm that the correct order had been shipped because the representative who emailed me had cited a different order number. I also cited the unprofessionalism of the email. I received a response apologizing for the unprofessional grammatical errors in the \\\"precious\\\" email. I received no apology for the lies, however, nor an incentive to try their services again.\\n\\nI received my order yesterday. It was missing four items and contained one wrong item. I sent a pretty angry and detailed email and posted a message on their Facebook page.\\n\\nI was contacted via phone today. I detailed the problem with the shipping, lying and now the missing/wrong items again. She said that the problem with shipping and being lied to had been taken care of internally. She was then ready to go. I had to ASK about the missing and wrong items. She asked what they were (which had already been detailed in my last email). She told me I would get a reimbursement to my account in 48-72 hours. Fine.\\n\\nA little while later, I get an email from a representative and a comment on my Facebook post, both saying that management had left me a message with their direct number to call and resolve the issue. WHAT?????? I just SPOKE with the representative and resolved the issue. They clearly have no clue what is happening in their own company!\\n\\nThe unprofessionalism and carelessness at Vitacost is unbelievable. I ordered from them to not just save on cost but also on time. The time I have had to put into this is greater than the time I would have spent just going to the store to get everything myself, which I now have to do anyway!\n",
      "0: Went here today to get some sushi grade salmon and tuna! This is my go-to place whenever I'm in the mood of making sushi. Fish is always fresh on all the times I've came. \\n\\nI also picked some beef and pork meat- both were good prices, cheaper than most places and are fresh.\\n\\nGot my vegetables from onions to eggplants. \\n\\nAlso passed by the bakery section and bought strawberry and taro cake @ $2.50/pc, haven't tried them, hope it's good!\\n\\nAlso passed by deli and bought some chickens feet @ $2.25/4 pcs -- I used to eat them back when I was little in the Philippines and haven't tried them since, I'd say it's pretty good from what I remember. \\n\\nOverall a great place to shop for asian food and delicacies, too bad it's about 40 minutes away from me.\n",
      "5: Lots of hands on stuff to do and explore. My faves - the robots - they never miss shooting baskets and will kick your ass at air hockey. Fun and informative way to kill an afternoon.\n",
      "0: I just started working at a corporate office in Scottsdale Quarter and tried out C3 on my second week. \\n\\nI have to say I was not impressed on any level.\\n\\nWell, that's not entirely true. The one level that was SUPER impressed about was this. There is a guy who takes orders and he was amazing. I waited in line for about 5 minutes and watched as he helped everyone in front of me with all kind of questions, issues, and orders. and He was hilarious when it was my time to order since it was my first time in the restaurant. I wish I would have caught his name to give him more kudos. \\n\\nOther than that though, I could give this place a C-. \\n\\nWe ordered a salad and a sandwich. My co workers salad arrived probably 20 + minutes after we ordered and my sandwich was nowhere in sight. After ten more minutes I went in to ask and was told \\\"its coming its coming hold on.\\\" five minutes later it showed up, soggy and extremely disappointing. I ate three bites, and decided to call it quits. My co workers salad looked delicious but I have no idea if it was or not. \\n\\nOverall, eh.\n",
      "5: Went to this place and it is the bomb. I had shrimp and it was delicious . I would definitely recommend this place for everyone.\n",
      "0: I was never really a fan of Hamburgers so my review won't be just on the food. \\n\\nThe Bad about this place. \\nVery crowded. Huge lines. No place to sit because of the crowds. Had to sit outside in 100degree Vegas heat. I think thats all I can think of...\\n\\nThe Good\\nVery quick service for these kind of lines. \\nThe burgers and fries tasted just like the ones we have at home in Los Angeles. Maybe alittle better even on the burger or maybe I was just hungry. Extra bathrooms in their second building for merchandise.\n",
      "5: Just opened and boy is the pizza great.  A awesome value at lunch, 10\\\" pizza or sub and drink for less than $6.  My son tried the wings the other night and rated them so so but that might be just because they just opened. I rate them certainly the best of the chain pizza restaurants.  I'll certainly be back.\n",
      "0: They do not have their own bathroom. I came here with my friends today and they told us if we had to go to the bathroom, we were going to have to go to the casino next door. \\n\\nWe're used to Froyo where we can get our own amounts and put our own toppings on it. If your used to this lifestyle, be prepared to be let down at Pinkberry on the strip. They serve the yogurt for you and put on the toppings for you. \\n\\nI guess in Vegas with all the intoxicated people you don't want a free for all topping service bar. Take me back to the Bay for Froyo, please!\n",
      "0: so far, this is the most deceptive yelp rating we have found. this is NOT a 4.5 star mexican restaurant., and it really isn't even a 3 star eatery. our start here was good, with tasty chips and salsa and a kind waitress whose english was very shaky (all of which we took as a promising sign).  we had high hopes as we waited far too long for our food, but the warning signs were already there; the worst margaritas ever, not even one other party arriving for dinner, and a drab dining room that looked much better in the photos. when the food finally did come, it was just disappointing.  and while the salsa that came with the chips was good, both the red sauce, and green sauce that was brought to the table with the food were both lousy. the beans were salty, the rice was weird, and i believe the taco shells were from a box. not one in our party of 5 were the slightest bit impressed with the food quality. not sure why it's so difficult to find decent mexican food in this town, but it is! steer far away from el ranchero, it's one of the poorest i have ever been to. cannot believe that some people ranked it so highly! the only one in the east valley has received rave reviews from us so far, has been \\\"susies mexican cafe\\\" in east tempe. take the drive!\n",
      "0: Pretty okay pizza.  Standard so-so Pittsburgh pizza.  However , the fact that the delivery driver expected me to run from my second floor apartment out to the middle of the street to get it was not okay.  He was rude when I asked him to come up, talking about how he has other deliveries to make and he couldn't park (meanwhile, there were multiple open parking spaces directly in front of the apartment; as well as an entire parking lot right next door). \\n\\nAfter arguing with me for a few minutes, he finally decided to park and come up. I really don't want to have to argue with someone to get them to do their job when I order delivery. And I certainly don't want to have to leave my house, to go out in the cold, for what is supposed to be delivery.   Is it so strange to expect food delivery to make it to my actual doorstep?  This seems to be a recent trend, pizza delivery people expecting the customer to run out into the street to get their pizza.  It stopped me from ordering from another place, and it will stop me from ordering from Ephesus again.\n",
      "5: Amazing atmosphere, great service, fantastic drinks and really good food.   For someone to say this place is over priced is  completely ridiculous.....  If you are paying $8 for a water in the hotel gift shop, what do you expect to pay for an entree at one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas?  Expect to spend like $75 a person if you order a 3 course meal with drinks.  I highly recommend this to any group, party or couple visiting Las Vegas.  This is my 2nd time at TAO and I have not had a bad meal.  You wont be disappointed!\n",
      "0: Tried Envy based on the ratings that people left.  However, came out feeling disappointed.  First off, we started with the mozzarella caprese.  This was our favorite dish with heirloom tomatoes and their balsamic vinegarette.  Next up, the seafood tower for 2.  Came with 2 King crab legs, 4 tiger prawns, 4 raw oysters, and 4 raw clams.  The entrees were truly UNexceptional.  I ordered the Pan Fried Chilean Sea Bass with crab on top which came with a mushy slimy pile of \\\"wild\\\" mushrooms.  Slightly undercooked and much too greasy for the Sea Bass.  My partner ordered the Rib Eye medium rare.  The outside was charred while the inside was rare-red.  In addition, there was a pool of oil in the middle of the steak.  We sent it back to get a second grilling since it was not medium rare.  The second round came back the same.  Sides included a garlic mashed potato and seasonal vegetables.  The potatos were good while the vegetables were mushy, charred, and came with sprigs of rosemary mixed in.  I ended up having to pick out the rosemary branches like fish bones as they were poking my mouth and unedible.  We also ordered the creamed corn side, which was surprisingly fresh.\\n\\nAll in all, not worth the price.  I'd say order the appetizers and sides, but stay away from the entrees.  In addition, service was pretty shoddy.  Our waiter kept disappearing.  I do however give props to the waiter's assistant.\n",
      "1: Just got back from a stay at the Phoenician.   Although the resort was beautiful, I was thoroughly disappointed in their service and won't return. I don't take a lot of vacations but do like to stay at a top notch place when I do go. For me, the service is by far the most important aspect on my trips and I found the staff at the Phoenician lacking in that respect. We were given a mountain view room. Typically, when I hear a hotel advertise mountain versus pool view rooms, it's not a big deal to me (in fact, I'd prefer the mountain except if I'm in a coastal hotel with a view of the ocean). In this case though, what they mean by mountain is opening your shade and being right next to a mountain (so close you can tell the bugs on the bushes). So essentially, you don't really have a view. That wasn't the greatest, but the bigger problem was I had no phone reception on half of the room and the other half I was only able to get one bar (clearly a result of being right next to a mountain). We went to the NCAA basketball game on our first day in town so we weren't in the room much. The next morning, I went down to use the fitness facility and found it to be sub-par for a hotel of the level of the Phoenician (needed a serious refresh...they have a bunch of antiquated machines and spin bikes). I asked the concierge if she knew of a track nearby (figured I'd just go for a jog instead since I didn't like the fitness center). She had some maps laid out for jogs on the complex but I informed her that running on asphalt takes its toll on my knees and that I really needed a track. I asked if there was a college nearby and she directed me to ASU, but gave me bad directions (had me turn right on Camelback and it should have been left). I drove for about 35 minutes and never came across the first street that I was supposed to turn on (Scottsdale Blvd). So that wasted over an hour of my time for nothing. As I kept having calls drop off on my phone, I became more annoyed with the situation and by Saturday morning complained to the front desk. The snooty clerk replied..\\\"well sir, we can't do anything about the way the hotel is constructed\\\". I thought to myself, so what are you saying?...your customers have to suck it up and deal with it? I would think a more professional clerk would have apologized for the inconvenience and immediately look to switch my room (instead of me telling the clerk that this wouldn't do). So I had the room switched but it wasn't available yet (it was 7am). He said I would receive a call informing me when the room was ready. By 12:30, we hadn't received a call and had to leave for the game so I called the front desk. The clerk said to leave our packed luggage on the bed and it would be moved for us to the new room by the time we got back. We arrived back at the hotel at 5. The new room was ready but the luggage hadn't been moved (they said they would take care of it right away). So we went to the bar for a little over an hour. We got back to the room...still no luggage. I called back to the desk and the clerk apologized and said it would be done right way). After another hour and still no luggage, I went to the desk and complained (we had 8 o'clock dinner reservations at a restaurant away from the hotel and needed to change clothes). We finally received our luggage just before 7:30 and needless to say didn't really have time to freshen up a bit before dinner (actually just got to the restaurant at 8). Although the front desk manager apologized the next day, it really didn't matter to me at that point. She asked what she could do to make me happy and offered to comp a massage or a free meal. I just asked if it was possible to get an \\\"uneventful\\\" day from her staff (which was really all I wanted all along). She had a look on her face like she didn't even know how to respond to that request (as though that might be asking the impossible). I mentioned that I really didn't think I was asking too much to have our luggage delivered and perhaps her staff could have at least made sure we had some ice (they don't have ice machines so we had to call room service for ice). She was surprised by the ice comment and questioned whether we had had turn down service (apparently the maids are supposed to deliver ice every night). I informed her we never received ice in the 3 nights we had been there and I had to call for it (and of course, tip their room service which I thought was bogus). She did end up comping our lunch but honestly it just didn't matter. I can't stand it when a 5 star hotel provides shoddy service like this. There are plenty of deals out there especially with the economy being in the shape it's in (even for 5 star hotels). My wife actually chose the hotel (I was pushing for the Four Seasons). The last day at the hotel was our 25th wedding anniversary, but I was just too annoyed to really enjoy it. Too bad the staff doesn't realize they ruin people's stays when they can't deliver a quality experience.\n",
      "5: I heard mixed reviews about Lure. We decided to try it out yesterday. This place has a great atmosphere. The food was delicious and service was great. I dont have anything negative to say.\n",
      "5: Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot.\n",
      "0: I was very disappointed with my meal here. It is WAY overpriced, even by Vegas standards.\\n\\nI had the Black Pepper chicken. It was like Beef and Broccoli, but with asparagus instead of the broc. Very bland and flavorless. Had to heap on the chili sauce to enhance the flavor. \\n\\nOthers in my group had the mushroom & poor noodle dish. The noodles were very good, but the mushroom sauce was just mediocre. Another dish we shared was the fried eggplant sauce. These were limp and soaked in oil. The flavor was fine, but there just wasnt much going on with this dish.\\n\\nWe had 3 iced teas at a whopping $5 each!!! As well as a side (1 cup) of steamed rice ($3). The final bill was $80. Ouch. I wasn't even full. We used a $50 food voucher and and I STILL felt like I overpaid. \\n\\nI would rather eat Panda Express and I don't even like that place.\\n\\nIf you are in Caesar's, come here and watch the chefs make fresh noodles and check out the decor. It's a super unique finish. But then keep moving...Vegas has too many great options to bother with this spot.\n"

      "0: This place is unique because you are sitting outside in a garden that is covered when it is raining, the food was alright but it was over priced and there are very limited options for vegetarians, and almost none for vegans.\\n\\nI know this isn't the right town for a vegetarian or a vegan but they could add a few more options for us. I am giving them 3 stars for the atmosphere and excellent service.\n",
      "3: Whew, $10 for a whiskey ginger ale and $18 for a martini.  We must be in Las Vegas. \\n\\nOh wait, yes we are.  Red Square is worth it for the ambiance, if you ask me.  I'd like to have seen more of what they had to offer.  The \\\"ice bar\\\" that gets a lot of hype isn't as impressive as it sounds.\\n\\nThe staff were pretty slow - I think 3 of them behind the bar, and we waited 10 minutes before being served and once our orders were taken they were in no rush to serve either.  Tipped minimally, but otherwise they weren't jerks or anything.  It's not like they were busy, either - it was a Tuesday night in February.  \\n\\nI'm being kind of hard on them, but we did have fun and it's a neat theme.  We did not go back in the vodka room, though.  Maybe next time.\n",
      "5: Loove me some Pei Wei! Boyfriend isn't a fan, so whenever I end up eating alone, this is my go-to. \\n\\nI have a bad habit of ordering the same thing over and over once I find something I like, so I can only say that the Dan-Dan Noodles are amazing! The eggrolls are also delicious. Taste can vary with regard to spiciness, but it's generally pretty consistent. \\n\\nTheir online ordering system is my favorite and my food is ready and waiting on time, every time. The staff is super friendly. \\n\\nGreat stop for some quick, tasty Asian food (I believe they cover at least 5 different Asian cuisines).\n",
      "0: I have been looking for a perfect Thai food restaurant for years and I have finally found it at Yupah's. I have tried countless Thai restaurants from Thai Rama to Latitude Eight to Thai basil and none of them compare to the food and atmosphere of Yupah's. \\n\\nThe prices are standard to Thai but the food is out of this world! You can really taste every single flavor. I tried the tom Kai gai coconut soup and it is by far my favorite. The lemon grass and spices are amazing. Every flavor is present served amazingly. The service is incredible as well. Everyone is extremely friendly. The red curry is without a doubt the best food on the menu. I absolutely love it. \\n\\nDefinitely go here. No other place compares! I love Yupah's!\n",
      "0: This restaurant has a nice classic American decor; kind of American farmer, Route 66ish decor..very quaint. The food was very good and the service was really good too. Family owned, you can tell that they really care about their customers.  We will definitely be coming back.\n",
      "4: DH was getting pizza at #1 Brothers so I originally tried to order from the Japanese restaurant in the same plaza, but they failed to answer the phone after we called FOUR times!  Thank goodness.  Went to Ari and got the usual excellent service and good sushi.  What made me feel good---I was explaining to the girl who answered the phone that I had ordered the spicy tuna handroll before and had been disappointed in its consistency and our server had suggested a order it more coarsely chopped.  The young lady on the phone said: \\\"Oh, yes, that was me---I was your server and I remember.  I know exactly what you want!\\\"  And she did.  My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.  Also, when I explained to her what my favorite specialty roll had been back at my old sushi joint, she was able to suggest a roll that very nearly the same and very good.  Actually, wait.  This was a Four star rather than a three star experience---let me go change my rating.  I feel like I have found my forever sushi place!  Thank you, Ari, for making me feel like a valued customer and not a faceless diner.\n",
      "1: A EVITER !\\n\\nNous avons attendu 2h45 pour avoir un plat de nachos... et le patron est venu m'insulter parce que je demandais un geste commercial pour cette attente interminable !! On parlait juste de chips avec de la sauce tomate... et ils n'\\u00e9taient m\\u00eame pas bons !!!\\n\\nNous n'y remettrons jamais les pieds. Nous trouverons une autre place pour voir les matchs des Canadiens \\n\\nUne \\u00e9toile,  pour les serveuses qui supportent un tel patron !\n",
      "0: DO NOT ORDER FROM VITACOST!!!\\n\\nI have never wanted to give a place a negative star rating more than I do this company.\\n\\nI placed an order last Monday. After it had not been shipped by Friday afternoon, I sent an email inquiring about the expected ship date. I then got onto their live chat with a customer service representative who told me that the order had been invoiced and shipped, it just wasn't posted yet. Later, I found out that she had lied to me and that the order shipped that night, after I had inquired about it. I received an email citing the wrong order number that also included gross grammatical errors (i.e., subject-verb agreement, thanking me for my \\\"patients\\\").\\n\\nI responded to complain that the live-chat representative had lied to me and also wanted to confirm that the correct order had been shipped because the representative who emailed me had cited a different order number. I also cited the unprofessionalism of the email. I received a response apologizing for the unprofessional grammatical errors in the \\\"precious\\\" email. I received no apology for the lies, however, nor an incentive to try their services again.\\n\\nI received my order yesterday. It was missing four items and contained one wrong item. I sent a pretty angry and detailed email and posted a message on their Facebook page.\\n\\nI was contacted via phone today. I detailed the problem with the shipping, lying and now the missing/wrong items again. She said that the problem with shipping and being lied to had been taken care of internally. She was then ready to go. I had to ASK about the missing and wrong items. She asked what they were (which had already been detailed in my last email). She told me I would get a reimbursement to my account in 48-72 hours. Fine.\\n\\nA little while later, I get an email from a representative and a comment on my Facebook post, both saying that management had left me a message with their direct number to call and resolve the issue. WHAT?????? I just SPOKE with the representative and resolved the issue. They clearly have no clue what is happening in their own company!\\n\\nThe unprofessionalism and carelessness at Vitacost is unbelievable. I ordered from them to not just save on cost but also on time. The time I have had to put into this is greater than the time I would have spent just going to the store to get everything myself, which I now have to do anyway!\n",
      "0: Went here today to get some sushi grade salmon and tuna! This is my go-to place whenever I'm in the mood of making sushi. Fish is always fresh on all the times I've came. \\n\\nI also picked some beef and pork meat- both were good prices, cheaper than most places and are fresh.\\n\\nGot my vegetables from onions to eggplants. \\n\\nAlso passed by the bakery section and bought strawberry and taro cake @ $2.50/pc, haven't tried them, hope it's good!\\n\\nAlso passed by deli and bought some chickens feet @ $2.25/4 pcs -- I used to eat them back when I was little in the Philippines and haven't tried them since, I'd say it's pretty good from what I remember. \\n\\nOverall a great place to shop for asian food and delicacies, too bad it's about 40 minutes away from me.\n",
      "5: Lots of hands on stuff to do and explore. My faves - the robots - they never miss shooting baskets and will kick your ass at air hockey. Fun and informative way to kill an afternoon.\n",
      "0: I just started working at a corporate office in Scottsdale Quarter and tried out C3 on my second week. \\n\\nI have to say I was not impressed on any level.\\n\\nWell, that's not entirely true. The one level that was SUPER impressed about was this. There is a guy who takes orders and he was amazing. I waited in line for about 5 minutes and watched as he helped everyone in front of me with all kind of questions, issues, and orders. and He was hilarious when it was my time to order since it was my first time in the restaurant. I wish I would have caught his name to give him more kudos. \\n\\nOther than that though, I could give this place a C-. \\n\\nWe ordered a salad and a sandwich. My co workers salad arrived probably 20 + minutes after we ordered and my sandwich was nowhere in sight. After ten more minutes I went in to ask and was told \\\"its coming its coming hold on.\\\" five minutes later it showed up, soggy and extremely disappointing. I ate three bites, and decided to call it quits. My co workers salad looked delicious but I have no idea if it was or not. \\n\\nOverall, eh.\n",
      "5: Went to this place and it is the bomb. I had shrimp and it was delicious . I would definitely recommend this place for everyone.\n",
      "0: I was never really a fan of Hamburgers so my review won't be just on the food. \\n\\nThe Bad about this place. \\nVery crowded. Huge lines. No place to sit because of the crowds. Had to sit outside in 100degree Vegas heat. I think thats all I can think of...\\n\\nThe Good\\nVery quick service for these kind of lines. \\nThe burgers and fries tasted just like the ones we have at home in Los Angeles. Maybe alittle better even on the burger or maybe I was just hungry. Extra bathrooms in their second building for merchandise.\n",
      "5: Just opened and boy is the pizza great.  A awesome value at lunch, 10\\\" pizza or sub and drink for less than $6.  My son tried the wings the other night and rated them so so but that might be just because they just opened. I rate them certainly the best of the chain pizza restaurants.  I'll certainly be back.\n",
      "0: They do not have their own bathroom. I came here with my friends today and they told us if we had to go to the bathroom, we were going to have to go to the casino next door. \\n\\nWe're used to Froyo where we can get our own amounts and put our own toppings on it. If your used to this lifestyle, be prepared to be let down at Pinkberry on the strip. They serve the yogurt for you and put on the toppings for you. \\n\\nI guess in Vegas with all the intoxicated people you don't want a free for all topping service bar. Take me back to the Bay for Froyo, please!\n",
      "0: so far, this is the most deceptive yelp rating we have found. this is NOT a 4.5 star mexican restaurant., and it really isn't even a 3 star eatery. our start here was good, with tasty chips and salsa and a kind waitress whose english was very shaky (all of which we took as a promising sign).  we had high hopes as we waited far too long for our food, but the warning signs were already there; the worst margaritas ever, not even one other party arriving for dinner, and a drab dining room that looked much better in the photos. when the food finally did come, it was just disappointing.  and while the salsa that came with the chips was good, both the red sauce, and green sauce that was brought to the table with the food were both lousy. the beans were salty, the rice was weird, and i believe the taco shells were from a box. not one in our party of 5 were the slightest bit impressed with the food quality. not sure why it's so difficult to find decent mexican food in this town, but it is! steer far away from el ranchero, it's one of the poorest i have ever been to. cannot believe that some people ranked it so highly! the only one in the east valley has received rave reviews from us so far, has been \\\"susies mexican cafe\\\" in east tempe. take the drive!\n",
      "0: Pretty okay pizza.  Standard so-so Pittsburgh pizza.  However , the fact that the delivery driver expected me to run from my second floor apartment out to the middle of the street to get it was not okay.  He was rude when I asked him to come up, talking about how he has other deliveries to make and he couldn't park (meanwhile, there were multiple open parking spaces directly in front of the apartment; as well as an entire parking lot right next door). \\n\\nAfter arguing with me for a few minutes, he finally decided to park and come up. I really don't want to have to argue with someone to get them to do their job when I order delivery. And I certainly don't want to have to leave my house, to go out in the cold, for what is supposed to be delivery.   Is it so strange to expect food delivery to make it to my actual doorstep?  This seems to be a recent trend, pizza delivery people expecting the customer to run out into the street to get their pizza.  It stopped me from ordering from another place, and it will stop me from ordering from Ephesus again.\n",
      "5: Amazing atmosphere, great service, fantastic drinks and really good food.   For someone to say this place is over priced is  completely ridiculous.....  If you are paying $8 for a water in the hotel gift shop, what do you expect to pay for an entree at one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas?  Expect to spend like $75 a person if you order a 3 course meal with drinks.  I highly recommend this to any group, party or couple visiting Las Vegas.  This is my 2nd time at TAO and I have not had a bad meal.  You wont be disappointed!\n",
      "0: Tried Envy based on the ratings that people left.  However, came out feeling disappointed.  First off, we started with the mozzarella caprese.  This was our favorite dish with heirloom tomatoes and their balsamic vinegarette.  Next up, the seafood tower for 2.  Came with 2 King crab legs, 4 tiger prawns, 4 raw oysters, and 4 raw clams.  The entrees were truly UNexceptional.  I ordered the Pan Fried Chilean Sea Bass with crab on top which came with a mushy slimy pile of \\\"wild\\\" mushrooms.  Slightly undercooked and much too greasy for the Sea Bass.  My partner ordered the Rib Eye medium rare.  The outside was charred while the inside was rare-red.  In addition, there was a pool of oil in the middle of the steak.  We sent it back to get a second grilling since it was not medium rare.  The second round came back the same.  Sides included a garlic mashed potato and seasonal vegetables.  The potatos were good while the vegetables were mushy, charred, and came with sprigs of rosemary mixed in.  I ended up having to pick out the rosemary branches like fish bones as they were poking my mouth and unedible.  We also ordered the creamed corn side, which was surprisingly fresh.\\n\\nAll in all, not worth the price.  I'd say order the appetizers and sides, but stay away from the entrees.  In addition, service was pretty shoddy.  Our waiter kept disappearing.  I do however give props to the waiter's assistant.\n",
      "1: Just got back from a stay at the Phoenician.   Although the resort was beautiful, I was thoroughly disappointed in their service and won't return. I don't take a lot of vacations but do like to stay at a top notch place when I do go. For me, the service is by far the most important aspect on my trips and I found the staff at the Phoenician lacking in that respect. We were given a mountain view room. Typically, when I hear a hotel advertise mountain versus pool view rooms, it's not a big deal to me (in fact, I'd prefer the mountain except if I'm in a coastal hotel with a view of the ocean). In this case though, what they mean by mountain is opening your shade and being right next to a mountain (so close you can tell the bugs on the bushes). So essentially, you don't really have a view. That wasn't the greatest, but the bigger problem was I had no phone reception on half of the room and the other half I was only able to get one bar (clearly a result of being right next to a mountain). We went to the NCAA basketball game on our first day in town so we weren't in the room much. The next morning, I went down to use the fitness facility and found it to be sub-par for a hotel of the level of the Phoenician (needed a serious refresh...they have a bunch of antiquated machines and spin bikes). I asked the concierge if she knew of a track nearby (figured I'd just go for a jog instead since I didn't like the fitness center). She had some maps laid out for jogs on the complex but I informed her that running on asphalt takes its toll on my knees and that I really needed a track. I asked if there was a college nearby and she directed me to ASU, but gave me bad directions (had me turn right on Camelback and it should have been left). I drove for about 35 minutes and never came across the first street that I was supposed to turn on (Scottsdale Blvd). So that wasted over an hour of my time for nothing. As I kept having calls drop off on my phone, I became more annoyed with the situation and by Saturday morning complained to the front desk. The snooty clerk replied..\\\"well sir, we can't do anything about the way the hotel is constructed\\\". I thought to myself, so what are you saying?...your customers have to suck it up and deal with it? I would think a more professional clerk would have apologized for the inconvenience and immediately look to switch my room (instead of me telling the clerk that this wouldn't do). So I had the room switched but it wasn't available yet (it was 7am). He said I would receive a call informing me when the room was ready. By 12:30, we hadn't received a call and had to leave for the game so I called the front desk. The clerk said to leave our packed luggage on the bed and it would be moved for us to the new room by the time we got back. We arrived back at the hotel at 5. The new room was ready but the luggage hadn't been moved (they said they would take care of it right away). So we went to the bar for a little over an hour. We got back to the room...still no luggage. I called back to the desk and the clerk apologized and said it would be done right way). After another hour and still no luggage, I went to the desk and complained (we had 8 o'clock dinner reservations at a restaurant away from the hotel and needed to change clothes). We finally received our luggage just before 7:30 and needless to say didn't really have time to freshen up a bit before dinner (actually just got to the restaurant at 8). Although the front desk manager apologized the next day, it really didn't matter to me at that point. She asked what she could do to make me happy and offered to comp a massage or a free meal. I just asked if it was possible to get an \\\"uneventful\\\" day from her staff (which was really all I wanted all along). She had a look on her face like she didn't even know how to respond to that request (as though that might be asking the impossible). I mentioned that I really didn't think I was asking too much to have our luggage delivered and perhaps her staff could have at least made sure we had some ice (they don't have ice machines so we had to call room service for ice). She was surprised by the ice comment and questioned whether we had had turn down service (apparently the maids are supposed to deliver ice every night). I informed her we never received ice in the 3 nights we had been there and I had to call for it (and of course, tip their room service which I thought was bogus). She did end up comping our lunch but honestly it just didn't matter. I can't stand it when a 5 star hotel provides shoddy service like this. There are plenty of deals out there especially with the economy being in the shape it's in (even for 5 star hotels). My wife actually chose the hotel (I was pushing for the Four Seasons). The last day at the hotel was our 25th wedding anniversary, but I was just too annoyed to really enjoy it. Too bad the staff doesn't realize they ruin people's stays when they can't deliver a quality experience.\n",
      "5: I heard mixed reviews about Lure. We decided to try it out yesterday. This place has a great atmosphere. The food was delicious and service was great. I dont have anything negative to say.\n",
      "5: Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot.\n",
      "0: I was very disappointed with my meal here. It is WAY overpriced, even by Vegas standards.\\n\\nI had the Black Pepper chicken. It was like Beef and Broccoli, but with asparagus instead of the broc. Very bland and flavorless. Had to heap on the chili sauce to enhance the flavor. \\n\\nOthers in my group had the mushroom & poor noodle dish. The noodles were very good, but the mushroom sauce was just mediocre. Another dish we shared was the fried eggplant sauce. These were limp and soaked in oil. The flavor was fine, but there just wasnt much going on with this dish.\\n\\nWe had 3 iced teas at a whopping $5 each!!! As well as a side (1 cup) of steamed rice ($3). The final bill was $80. Ouch. I wasn't even full. We used a $50 food voucher and and I STILL felt like I overpaid. \\n\\nI would rather eat Panda Express and I don't even like that place.\\n\\nIf you are in Caesar's, come here and watch the chefs make fresh noodles and check out the decor. It's a super unique finish. But then keep moving...Vegas has too many great options to bother with this spot.\n"
