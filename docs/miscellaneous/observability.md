# Observability

## Graph
You can visualize all `Updatables` in a graph. 

- `GRAPH=0`: No graph
- `GRAPH=1`: Minimal graph
- `GRAPH=2`: Most of the time, this is the best option
- `GRAPH=3`: Full graph, can be very verbose

## Debug
TBD
<!-- You can enable debug logs, including all prompt that actually sent to LLM.

- `DEBUG=0`: No debug -->
