# Design Goals

## Local First
By default, there is no cloud dashboard or something. You run evaluation on your machine with your API key and data.

## Framework Agnostic
FastREPL should work with any framework or setup. (It should be written in Python though.)

## No Black Magic
Readability is preferred over simplicity. 

## No Integration
There should be no need for specific integration implemented here. If you need one, it should be easy to plug in by yourself.
