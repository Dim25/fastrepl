# Model Graded Evaluation
There are some metric like [`rouge`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/rouge), but for most cases, especially in business, you'll need to evaluate more complex aspects of your model. 

## High level of consensus
> This Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ctgygDRJhVGUJTQy8-bRZCl1WNcT8De6?usp=sharing) shows how to compute the agreement between humans and GPT-4 judge with the dataset. Our results show that humans and GPT-4 judge achieve over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans.
